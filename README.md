# BetterParties
Forces quest completion synchronization between BQ party members. \
This mod depends on [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter) and BQ or BQu.

## Configuration
There are 4 total configuration options:
1) Sync Command - adds `/party_sync` to forcefully sync quests with all members
2) Shared Completion - quest completion is shared between team members
3) Shared Rewards - once any team member claimed a reward, it is claimed for others
4) Sync On Join - synchronizes quests with team members on player joining to a party

## Any issues?
If there any issues like de-sync, use `/bq_user sync` to forcefully sync quests with all members. \
**Keep in mind that this command only does it for you, not for other members!**
