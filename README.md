# BetterParties
Forces quest completion synchronization between BQ party members.

## Configuration
There are 3 total configuration options:
1) Sync Command - adds `/bq_user sync` to forcefully sync quests with all members
2) Shared Completion - quest completion is shared between team members
3) Shared Rewards - once any team member claimed a reward, it is claimed for others
4) Sync On Join - synchronizes quests with team members on player joining to a party

## Any issues?
If there any issues like de-sync, use `/bq_user sync` to forcefully sync quests with all members. \
**Keep in mind that this command only does it for you, not for other members!** \
